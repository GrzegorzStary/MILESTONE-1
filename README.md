# Bugs

- There were many bugs on the website, most of them related to poor responsiveness and alignment issues with the boxes on the site. These bugs were fixed by adjusting values within the CSS file.
- Another issue was with the contact form: the number field was accepting both numbers and letters. This was fixed with a slight adjustment, thanks to ChatGPT, as I didn't have enough knowledge to resolve it on my own.
- There were issues with the scroll bar of Gallery the "clickable buttons" to scroll the page were invisible.
- The website initially lacked a box for the address, which was added later.
- Currently, there are no known bugs remaining.

- The gallery was created by following Youtube tutorial and its completed with HTML and CSS only without involvment of JavaScript.
- Code was in 95% written by myself.
